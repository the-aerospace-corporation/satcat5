// Multipurpose circular buffer
//
// The PacketBuffer class is a wrapper for a circular buffer, with optional
// logic to support retention of frame/packet boundaries.  It implements the
// "Readable" and "Writeable" interfaces so that it can be used with many
// other SatCat5 stream-processing tools.
//
// PacketBuffer also acts as a thread-safe barrier, e.g., for data that is
// written in the interrupt context and read in the general-use context, or
// vice-versa.  For performance reasons, these protections are applied at
// write_finalize() and read_finalize().  Users writing from multiple threads
// or reading from multiple threads should provide their own safety systems.
//
// To allow greater flexibility in memory allocation, the underlying working
// memory is NOT declared as part of this class.  Instead, its address and
// size are arguments to the constructor.
//
// Example unpacketized stream:
//      u8 raw_buffer[1024];
//      PacketBuffer pkt_buffer(raw_buffer, sizeof(raw_buffer));
//
// Example packetized stream (up to 16 queued packets):
//      u8 raw_buffer[1024];
//      PacketBuffer pkt_buffer(raw_buffer, sizeof(raw_buffer), 16);
//
// In typical usage, a user calls write_xx methods to construct a packet
// field by field, then calls write_overflow.  In the event of an overflow
// in the middle of this process, the incomplete partial frame is discarded.
// The user can also trigger this manually by calling write_abort().
//
// Maximum size of each frame is limited to the main buffer size or 64 kiB,
// whichever is smaller.
//
