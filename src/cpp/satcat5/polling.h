//! Core event-processing loop for SatCat5 software
//!
//! \details
//! This file defines the main event-processing loop for all SatCat5
//! software.  To function properly, SatCat5 requires users to connect
//! several subsystems to platform-specific logic:
//!  * Call timekeeper::request_poll() at regular intervals.
//!     * In FreeRTOS, this should be linked to the system tick.
//!       (See hal_freertos/satcat_task.h)
//!     * In Linux or Windows systems, use the PosixTimekeeper class.
//!       (See hal_posix/posix_utils.h)
//!     * In baremetal systems, this may be linked to a timer interrupt.
//!       (See cfgbus_timer.h for one possible implementation)
//!     * In other systems, consider using the VirtualTimer class.
//!  * Call satcat5::poll::service_all() at frequent intervals.
//!     * In FreeRTOS, this should be linked to the system tick.
//!     * In baremetal systems, this may be an infinite loop:
//!         `while(1) {satcat5::poll::service_all();}`
//!  * (Optional) Set the elapsed-time reference (TimeRef).
//!     * Use timekeeper::set_clock() to force a specific reference.
//!     * Use timekeeper::suggest_clock() to automatically select
//!       the "best" reference from among all suggested clocks.
//!     * If no TimeRef is provided, poll timekeeper at exactly 1 kHz.
//!
//! SatCat5 event-processing is single-threaded.  Each call to the main
//! service function (i.e., satcat5::poll::service_all()) processes all
//! queued events in sequence.
//!
//! There are three built-in event types:
//!  * satcat5::poll::Always
//!      This object is polled whenever the main service function is called.
//!      (Users may inherit from this class and override "poll_always".)
//!  * satcat5::poll::OnDemand
//!      This object is polled only after request_poll() method has been called.
//!      For example, many interrupt handlers call request_poll() in order to
//!      request additional service at the next convenient time.  This method
//!      is also used for io::Readable::data_rcvd() callbacks.
//!      (Users may inherit from this class and override "poll_demand".)
//!  * satcat5::poll::Timer
//!      Poll this object at a designated time, or at a designated interval.
//!      (Users may inherit from this class and override "timer_event".)
