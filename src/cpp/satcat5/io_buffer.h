        // It grants the public "Writable" and "Readable" interfaces and makes
        // the buffered data available to the inner class.
        //
        // To use, set up a parent class that:
        //  * Inherits from BufferedIO.
        //  * Provides the raw working buffers for each PacketBuffer instance.
        //  * Passes the parameters for these to the BufferedIO constructor.
        //    (These buffers can be used in packet mode or contiguous mode.)
        //  * Implements the "data_rcvd()" method to handle new outgoing data.
        //    (i.e., By calling the read_xx methods on "m_tx".)
        //  * Writes any incoming received data to the "m_rx" buffer.
